        p1: "Introducing Wizer, the gamified mobile e-commerce platform that connects the experiences of purchasing in-stores and the metaverse. Our platform offers a unique method to relax and explore the outside world online.",

        p2: "Wizer aspires to bring people together in the metaverse and give them an avatar-based experience that resembles physical purchasing. With the movement of the tech world towards Web 3.0, we believe that a metaverse-based e-commerce website can lead to a great user experience. Additionally, with the use of blockchain technology for transactions and data storage, security is also greatly enhanced.",

        p3: "Our platform features include AR technology that blends digital and three-dimensional components with an individual's perception of the real world. The present e-commerce applications allow users to view commodities in the form of images, but Wizer takes it a step further by allowing users to view products from all angles and directions with our 3D viewer. Users can also collect metacoins from the metaverse, view them in the account section, and avail amazing offers and discounts. Our search functionality helps users find relevant products by specifying keywords or phrases, and users can also share their experiences with a product or service and give it an overall star rating. Payment for products can be made through online methods such as Google Pay.",

        p4: "In the metaverse, Wizer offers personalized avatars, which help people express emotions online with much more detail than plain old texting. Users can customize their own avatars and chat and shop with others in a connected space. Our virtual try-on technology lets customers see how clothes fit on their avatar, allowing them to virtually “try on” clothing before purchasing, without even leaving their house. Users can also place any ad, poster, or banner they want to play in the store and Wizer provides a gamified ancient virtual space for users to shop with a new experience in the land of fantasy - mystic birds drifting along the wind, in-motion billboards, something way beyond the old shopping style. The products kept on display have a default auto-rotate feature without any friction. The users can also unlock metacoins through shopping, hunt and collect them from the metaverse and access them from the account section of the app.",

        p5: "Wizer aims to make the shopping experience better. It's for people to connect virtually to shop in the exact same manner as in offline shopping. Keeping it user-friendly irrespective of any age difference, in short, providing the same platform where people meet using avatars. To visualize things in real-time with the use of VR & AR and even implement virtual try-on. It aims to help all the 3.8 billion e-commerce users to have a better experience while shopping.",

        p6: "The platform is well-organized and has clean code. The data and operations are optimized to remove any unnecessary dependencies between the classes. The code is self-documented and has high readability. The code uses the concept of modularity and abstraction to make use of reusability. The code is highly robust and reliable, making it perform well even under high server load. The UI is clean, and the UX is built after a good amount of research, making it customer-centric and user-focused.Please note that the metaverse is currently only available on local host and on the web, which will be redirected from the mobile application. The metaverse also only comes with global chat and currently has only one shop for testing purposes. Wizer is made using Decentraland SDK, Flutter, ExpressJS, NodeJS, designs were made in Figma, 3D modeling in Blender, and video edit in Premiere Pro and After Effects.",
